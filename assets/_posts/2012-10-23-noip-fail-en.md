Guangzhou 50 plus can get in, I can't. Too late. Too late. I feel that those brilliant people in cultural sciences may not have me. Yes, high school 1st and 2nd year, compared to OI, I still invested a lot of time in cultural sciences. Now cultural sciences can score over 600.

If that cannot enter, let's focus on doing well in current things. I want to give it my all in college entrance exams, and fight alongside more brothers and sisters!

I believe that while honing my programming abilities, my learning ability becomes increasingly powerful. In the process of understanding those difficult problem solutions, I learned how to think and how to read.

The reasons for not understanding a piece of literature are mainly two: 1) not reading carefully enough. 2) the material is not suitable, lacking the basic knowledge required to understand it.

Well, I'll use the self-study abilities I've learned while training my programming skills to apply to cultural subjects, and beat the masses!

Well, the worse the current situation is, the better, because the more remarkable miracles can be created! I'm not in a hurry, I plan to use time to enrich myself, and exchange results with patience!

Fellow brothers who couldn't make it to college through OI, let's work hard together! Congratulations to the brothers who were admitted, you can focus on your passion, and become a master earlier!

ps: I bought Liu Ruija's Guidebook and it's great, I'm going to read it right after the college entrance exam.
