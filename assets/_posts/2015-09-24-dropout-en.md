Dear respected school leaders:

Greetings. I am Zhiwei from Computer Science Class 13-4. I took a year off and, after careful consideration, have decided to apply for withdrawal.

During that year, I worked at LeanCloud. The company joined Microsoft Accelerator and received A round funding. Our user base grew significantly. I was involved in various aspects of the product. I significantly improved the company's product and developed the Android and iOS versions of LeanChat social application independently and uploaded them to the App Store. I also developed the iOS low-level framework, enabling our users (developers) to quickly and effectively create their applications using our developed framework. I made significant contributions in technical support, development documents, etc. The company benefits were not bad, with stock options for all employees, and as one of the engineers, I also held some stock options. I have communicated with the boss recently, who hopes I can stay and continue our journey together, believing that I can make greater contributions to the company. However, after repeated communications with my parents, I have obtained their consent to apply for withdrawal. Considering full-time work at a startup company, learning and accumulating professional technical knowledge, and participating in the creation process, may be more beneficial for my personal development.

I am glad to have studied at Beijing Forest University for a year, with a beautiful campus environment and excellent conditions, providing a large development space for people. During my freshman year, I developed the "North Forest Assistant" mobile application for Beijing Forest University students to check their grades, which now has accumulated over three thousand users. I have received third place in hackathon marathons, second place in the national software contest held by the China Software Industry Association, and third place in the new media project contest co-hosted by China Media University and the United Nations Association. I also collaborated with my graduate student researcher and professor to complete a plant recognition photo application.

I hereby apply for withdrawal from the school and hope for approval from the school leaders.

Sincerely, Respectfully.

Applicant: Zhiwei
