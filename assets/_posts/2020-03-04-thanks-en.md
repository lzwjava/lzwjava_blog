title: "A Salute to All Workers"
---

Today, I received countless app updates and platform content pushes. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the people behind these efforts!

After a few years of navigating the complexities of society, I've come to deeply appreciate how challenging life can be. So many apps fail, and many content creators and hardworking individuals go unrewarded. You've all worked incredibly hard. If you haven't received the recognition you deserve, it's not your fault. Everyone is struggling, everyone is giving so much and getting so little in return. Despite all your hard work, you're still fighting to make ends meet with mortgages, rent, and the high cost of living.

Imagine if the hundreds of thousands or even millions we spend on housing were used to support all the workers in our lives. How much better off would they be? We could all enjoy a comfortable life and have a few hundred thousand to spare. But as it stands, our lives are consumed by mortgage payments or saving for a down payment.

There's no need to feel sad or guilty for not owning a home in the city. When everyone is struggling to afford housing and live in big cities, it's not our fault. We're working so hard and still can't make ends meet, so it's not because we're lazy or unmotivated. 

Friends, you've all worked incredibly hard. I hope we have a brighter future ahead.
