In the last session, we refactored the Fibonacci sequence functionality into an object-oriented version and implemented a terminal interface.

`server.py`:

```python
class BaseHandler:
  def handle(self, request: str):
    pass

class Server:
  def __init__(self, handlerClass):
    self.handlerClass = handlerClass

  def run(self):
    while True:
      request = input()
      self.handlerClass().handle(request)
```

`fib_handle.py`:

```python
from fib import f
from server import BaseHandler, Server

class FibHandler(BaseHandler):
  def handle(self, request: str):
    n = int(request)
    print('f(n)=', f(n))
    pass

server = Server(FibHandler)
server.run()
```

## Simple Web Server

How do we change this to a `Web` interface?

We need to replace the `Server` with an `HTTP protocol` server. Let's first look at what an HTTP server in Python looks like.

Pythonâ€™s standard library provides a simple web server.

```shell
python -m http.server
```

Run this in the terminal.

```shell
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
```

You can see the result by opening it in a browser.

This lists the current directory. When you browse this webpage, go back and check the terminal. It's quite interesting.

```shell
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] code 404, message File not found
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] code 404, message File not found
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] "GET /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png HTTP/1.1" 404 -
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] code 404, message File not found
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:35] "GET /apple-touch-icon.png HTTP/1.1" 404 -
::1 - - [07/Mar/2021 15:30:38] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

These are the web access logs. `GET` indicates a type of data access operation for the web service, and `HTTP/1.1` indicates that the `1.1` version of the `HTTP` protocol was used.

How do we use this to create our Fibonacci sequence service? Let's look for some example code online and modify it to write a simple web server:

```python
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class Handler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes("hi", "utf-8"))

server = HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 8000), Handler)

server.serve_forever()
```

Does this look familiar? It's almost the same as our previous `Server` implementation. Note that `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` is not a base class; there's also `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` handles some additional content. Adding the Fibonacci sequence handling functionality to this is easy.

Here, `127.0.0.1` represents the local machine address, and `8000` represents the local port. Think of the port like a window in a house, a way to communicate with the outside world. `bytes` converts a string to bytes. `utf-8` is a string encoding method. `send_response`, `send_header`, and `end_headers` are used to output content as specified by the `HTTP` protocol so it can be understood by the browser. This way, we see `hi` in the browser.

<img src="/assets/images/web/hi.png" alt="hi" style="zoom:50%;" />

Next, let's try getting parameters from the request.

```python
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from fib import f
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

class Handler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text')
        self.end_headers()
        parsed = urlparse(self.path)
        qs = parse_qs(parsed.query)
        result = ""
        if 'n' in qs:
            n = int(qs['n'][0])
            result = str(f(n))
        self.wfile.write(bytes(result, "utf-8"))

server = HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 8000), Handler)

server.serve_forever()
```

<img src="/assets/images/web/n10.png" alt="n10" style="zoom:50%;" />

It's a bit complex, parsing some parameters here.

```shell
self.path=/?n=3
parsed=ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='/', params='', query='n=3', fragment='')
qs={'n': ['3']}
ns=['3']
n=3
```

## Recursive Improvements

Let's refactor the code a bit.

```python
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from fib import f
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

class Handler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def parse_n(self, s):
        parsed = urlparse(s)
        qs = parse_qs(parsed.query)
        if 'n' in qs:
            return int(qs['n'][0])
        return None

    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text')
        self.end_headers()
        result = ""
        n = self.parse_n(self.path)
        if n is not None:
            result = str(f(n))
        self.wfile.write(bytes(result, "utf-8"))

server = HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 8000), Handler)

server.serve_forever()
```

We introduced the `parse_n` function to encapsulate the parsing of `n` from the request path.

Now we face an issue. If someone requests the 10000th Fibonacci number, it will take a long time to compute. If someone else requests it again, it will again take a long time. How do we improve the efficiency of this `Web service`?

Note that if `n` is the same, `f(n)` is always the same. We conducted some experiments.

```shell
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Mar/2021 00:33:01] "GET /?n=1000 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
----------------------------------------
Exception occurred during processing of request from ('127.0.0.1', 50783)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    if v[n] != -1:
IndexError: list index out of range
```

It turns out the array wasn't large enough, so we changed the size of the `v` array to 10000.

```python
v = [-1] * 10000
```

However, when `n` is `2000`, a recursion depth exceeded error occurs:

```shell
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Mar/2021 00:34:00] "GET /?n=2000 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
----------------------------------------
Exception occurred during processing of request from ('127.0.0.1', 50821)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    if v[n] != -1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
```

Still, it's quite fast.

Why? Because `f(1)` to `f(1000)` only need to be computed once. This means that when calculating `f(1000)`, the `+` operation might only be executed around 1000 times. We know that Python's recursion depth limit is around 1000. This means we can optimize the program this way: if we need to calculate `2000`, we first calculate `1000`. No, this might still cause a recursion depth exceeded error. If we need to calculate 2000, we first calculate 1200. If we need to calculate 1200, we first calculate 400.

After calculating 400 and 1200, calculating 2000 would have a recursion depth of about 800, avoiding the recursion depth exceeded error.

```python
v = [-1] * 1000000

def fplus(n):
    if n > 800:
        fplus(n - 800)
        return f(n)
    else:
        return f(n)

def f(n):
    if v[n] != -1:
        return v[n]
    else:
        if n < 2:
            a = n
        else:
            a = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        v[n] = a
        return v[n]
```

We added the `fplus` function

.

But one might wonder, what if `fplus` is recursively called `1000` times? 1000 * 800 = 800000. When I set `n` to 800000, a recursion depth error occurred again. Further testing showed things were more complex. However, after this optimization, calculating 2000 is very easy.

## File Read and Write

It seems we have diverged a bit. Let's return to the topic of web development. If the first request is for `f(400)`, and the second request is for `f(600)`, we can use the `v` array values from the first request for the second. However, if we restart the program, we lose the cached values. If Fibonacci sequence calculations are slow, especially without the `v` array, there would be a lot of redundant calculations. We want to save the hard-won results.

This introduces the concept of `caching`. Here, the `v` array is a cache, but it only exists during the program's lifecycle. When the program closes, it disappears. What do we do?

We can save it to a file.

How do we save the `v` array to a file?

```plaintext
0 0
1 1
2 1
3 2
4 3
...
```

We can save the `v` array like this. Each line is saved as `n f(n)`. Since `n` grows naturally, we could also save just the `f(n)` values.

```plaintext
0
1
1
2
3
...
```

Let's try it.

```python
f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

# Open and read the file after appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
```

The second parameter of `open` can be `a`, which appends to the file, or `w`, which overwrites it.

```python
file = open('fib_v', 'a')
file.write('hi')
file.close()
```

Run it, and indeed a file named `fib_v` appears.

`fib_v`:

```plaintext
hi
```

When we run it again, it becomes:

```plaintext
hihi
```

How do we add a newline?

```python
file = open('fib_v', 'a')
file.write('hi\n')
file.close()
```

When we print it once, it shows `hihihi` with no visible newline. However, printing again shows the newline. The first print already added the newline character, but it's at the end, so it's not visible.

How do we read it?

```python
file = open('fib_v', 'r')
print(file.read())
```

```shell
$ python fib.py
hihihi
hi
```

Now, let's modify our Fibonacci program.

```python
v = [-1] * 1000000

def read():
    file = open('fib_v', 'r')
    s = file.read()
    if len(s) > 0:
        lines = s.split('\n')
        for i in range(len(lines)):
            v[i] = int(lines[i])

def save():
    file = open('fib_v', 'w')
    s = ''
    start = True
    for vv in v:
        if vv == -1:
            break
        if not start:
            s += '\n'
        start = False
        s += str(vv)
    file.write(s)
    file.close()

def fcache(n):
    x = fplus(n)
    save()
    return x

def fplus(n):
    if n > 800:
        fplus(n - 800)
        return f(n)
    else:
        return f(n)

def f(n):
    if v[n] != -1:
        return v[n]
    else:
        if n < 2:
            a = n
        else:
            a = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        v[n] = a
        return v[n]

read()
fcache(10)
save()
```

Finally, we have the program. After running the program, the `fib_v` file looks like this:

`fib_v`:

```plaintext
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

You can see the parsing is a bit cumbersome. The `\n` is the newline character. Is there a simpler, more uniform way to parse it? People invented the `JSON` data format.

## JSON

JSON stands for `JavaScript Object Notation`. Here is an example of `JSON`:

```json
{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}
```

This represents a mapping.

JSON has basic elements:

1. Numbers or strings
2. Lists
3. Mappings

These basic elements can be nested arbitrarily. For example, a list can contain lists, and a mapping can contain lists, and so on.

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "cars": ["Ford", "BMW", "Fiat"]
}
```

Writing it in one line or making it look better doesn't change its meaning. We can imagine their computational graph. Spaces do not affect their computational graph.

Next, let's convert the `v` array to a JSON formatted string.

```python
import json

v = [-1] * 1000000

def fplus(n):
    if n > 800:
        fplus(n - 800)
        return f(n)
    else:
        return f(n)

def f(n):
    if v[n] != -1:
        return v[n]
    else:
        if n < 2:
            a = n
        else:
            a = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        v[n] = a
        return v[n]

fplus(100)
s = json.dumps(v)
file = open('fib_j', 'w')
file.write(s)
file.close()
```

When we write it this way, we get an error. `TypeError: dump() missing 1 required positional argument: 'fp'`. In `vscode`, you can see the function definition like this.

![json](assets/images/web/json.png)

You can hover over `dump` with your mouse. Very convenient, right?

```python
fplus(10)
file = open('fib_j', 'w')
json.dump(v, file)
file.close()
```

I changed the computation to 10 because there were too many numbers at 100. It turns out the second parameter of `dump` should be the `file` object.

Now we see the file:

```json
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, -1, -1, -1]
```

Notice that many `-1` values are omitted at the end.

```python
def read():
    file = open('fib_j', 'r')
    s = file.read()
    sv = json.loads(s)
    for i in range(len(sv)):
        if sv[i] != -1:
            v[i] = sv[i]
def save():
    file = open('fib_j', 'w')
    json.dump(v, file)
    file.close()

read()

for vv in v:
    if vv != -1:
        print(vv)
```

When we do this, it prints:

```shell
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

Now let's check these functions together:

```python
def read():
    file = open('fib_j', 'r')
    s = file.read()
    sv = json.loads(s)
    for i in range(len(sv)):
        v[i] = sv[i]

def save():
    sv = []
    for i in range(len(v)):
        if v[i] != -1:
            sv.append(v[i])
        else:
            break
    file = open('fib_j', 'w')
    json.dump(sv, file)
    file.close()

read()
fplus(100)
save()
```

Checking the file shows the correct values are saved neatly.

```json
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887, 9227465, 14930352, 24157817, 39088169, 63245986, 102334155, 165580141, 267914296, 433494437, 701408733, 1134903170, 1836311903, 2971215073, 4807526976, 7778742049, 12586269025, 20365011074, 32951280099, 53316291173, 86267571272, 139583862445, 225851433717, 365435296162, 591286729879, 956722026041, 1548008755920, 250473078196

```

## Database

What if the data is large and complex? Using files becomes slow and cumbersome. This introduces the concept of a `database`, which is like a programmable `Excel` sheet that can easily be manipulated with code.

From the official documentation, here's an example.

```python
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
```

```python
cur = con.cursor()

# Create table
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE stocks
               (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')

# Insert a row of data
cur.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)")

# Save (commit) the changes
con.commit()

# We can also close the connection if we are done with it.
# Just be sure any changes have been committed or they will be lost.
con.close()
```

```python
for row in cur.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks ORDER BY price'):
    print(row)
```

`cursor` represents a cursor, similar to a pointer. The above code connects to a database, creates a table, inserts data, commits changes, and closes the connection. The last example shows how to query data.

```python
import sqlite3

v = [-1] * 1000000

def create_table(cur: sqlite3.Connection):
    cur.execute('CREATE TABLE vs(v text)')

def read():
    pass

def save():
    con = sqlite3.connect('fib.db')
    cur = con.cursor()
    create_table(cur)
    for vv in v:
        if vv != -1:
            cur.execute('INSERT INTO vs VALUES(' + str(vv) + ')')
        else:
            break
    con.commit()
    con.close()

fplus(10)
save()
```

Let's try running it.

I already have `sqlite3` installed on my computer.

You can see many commands. `.quit` means exit.

If you don't have it, you can download it from the official website, or run `brew install sqlite` to install it.

```shell
$ sqlite3 fib.db
```

```sqlite
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE vs(v text);
```

Initially, I thought it was like `MySQL` where you use `show tables`. Later, I found out in `SQLite`, it's like this. `MySQL` is another database we will learn about in the future.

```sqlite
sqlite> select * from vs;
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

Indeed, we correctly wrote the data. Note we used `text` because our numbers are large, and the database's integer type might not store them.

```python
import sqlite3

v = [-1] * 1000000

def fplus(n):
    if n > 800:
        fplus(n - 800)
        return f(n)
    else:
        return f(n)

def f(n):
    if v[n] != -1:
        return v[n]
    else:
        if n < 2:
            a = n
        else:
            a = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        v[n] = a
        return v[n]

def create_table(cur: sqlite3.Connection):
    cur.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vs(v text)')

def read():
    con = sqlite3.connect('fib.db')
    cur = con.cursor()
    create_table(cur)
    i = 0
    for row in cur.execute('SELECT * from vs'):
        v[i] = int(row[0])
        i += 1
    con.close()

def save():
    con = sqlite3.connect('fib.db')
    cur = con.cursor()
    create_table(cur)
    for vv in v:
        if vv != -1:
            cur

.execute("INSERT INTO vs VALUES('" + str(vv) + "')")
        else:
            break
    con.commit()
    con.close()

read()
for i in range(10):
    print(v[i])
```

We updated the `read` function. But when we ran it, we got an error.

```shell
$ python fib_db.py
  ...
  File "fib_db.py", line 27, in create_table
    cur.execute('CREATE TABLE vs(v text)')
sqlite3.OperationalError: table vs already exists
```

We can't create the table again; it already exists. We modify the syntax slightly.

```python
def create_table(cur: sqlite3.Connection):
    cur.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vs(v text)')
```

But we encountered another error.

```shell
    v[i] = int(row[0])
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1.22001604151219e+19'
```

Why? Because numbers are saved as strings. We modify the code to read the values correctly.

```python
def read():
    con = sqlite3.connect('fib.db')
    cur = con.cursor()
    create_table(cur)
    i = 0
    for row in cur.execute('SELECT * from vs'):
        v[i] = int(row[0])
        i += 1
    con.close()
```

We realized `i` wasn't incrementing.

```python
    for row in cur.execute('SELECT * from vs'):
        v[i] = int(row[0])
        i += 1
```

Now it's correct.

```shell
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

Note that when the numbers are large, they are saved like this:

```shell
4660046610375530309
7540113804746346429
1.22001604151219e+19
1.97402742198682e+19
3.19404346349901e+19
```

Running it again shows this:

```shell
$ python fib_db.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "fib_db.py", line 35, in read
    v[i] = int(row[0])
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1.22001604151219e+19'
```

We modify:

```python
cur.execute("INSERT INTO vs VALUES('" + str(vv) + "')")
```

Notice we use double quotes for `INSERT` and enclose our number strings in quotes. If we had written this earlier, the database would have treated our string as a number. Now, with quotes, it treats it as a string.

It works correctly. But how do we clear the previous erroneous data?

```sqlite
$ sqlite3 fib.db
sqlite> delete from vs;
```

Next, we can try other operations. We have shown examples of `insert`, `delete`, and `select`.

## Practice

* Students should explore the above steps similarly.
