 This lesson covers the following topics:

* Spark
* Hadoop
* Kubernetes I'd like to talk about cloud computing, it seems we can't do without many tools: Hadoop, Hive, Hbase, ZooKeeper, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Kafka, MongoDB, Flink, Druid, Presto, Kylin, Elastic Search. Have you heard of them? I found these from job descriptions for a "Big Data Engineer" and "Distributed Backend Engineer". These are high-paying positions. Let's try installing them all and giving them a spin.

## Getting Started with Spark

Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and machine learning. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

To get started with Spark, you need to install it on your machine or cluster. Here's a step-by-step guide for installing Spark on a local machine using Homebrew on macOS:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

   ```
   brew install adoptopenjdk
   ```

2. Add JDK to environment variables:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/libexec)
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

3. Install Spark:

   ```
   brew install apache-spark
   ```

4. Add Spark to environment variables:

   ```
   export SPARK_HOME=$(brew --prefix apache-spark)
   export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

5. Verify the installation:

   ```
   spark-shell --version
   ```

   You should see the Spark version number displayed.

Now that Spark is installed, you can start using it for data processing and machine learning tasks. You can write Spark applications in Scala, Java, or Python. To learn more about Spark, check out the official documentation: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html. The website states that `Spark` is an engine for analyzing large-scale data. `Spark` is a suite of libraries. It seems different from `Redis` which is divided into server and client. `Spark` is only used on the client side. Downloaded the latest version from the website, `spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop3.2.tar`.

The website also mentions that you can directly install the dependency library on Python with `pip install pyspark`. install pyspark

This will check the official website for some examples.

```shell
./bin/run-example SparkPi 10
``` Oh, it turns out I can run the program in the just downloaded installation package. But an error occurred.

$ ./bin/run-example SparkPi 10
21/03/11 00:06:15 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable

Spark is a fast and general engine for processing data compatible with Hadoop. It can run in Hadoop clusters through YARN or Spark's standalone mode, and it can process data in HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Hive, and any Hadoop InputFormat. It is designed to perform both batch processing, similar to MapReduce, and new workloads like streaming, interactive queries, and machine learning.
## Hadoop Explanation

Spark is a fast and versatile data processing engine that works seamlessly with Hadoop. It can operate in Hadoop clusters using YARN (Yet Another Resource Manager) or Spark's standalone mode. Spark can process data stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), HBase, Cassandra, Hive, and any other Hadoop InputFormat.

Spark is designed to handle both batch processing, which is similar to MapReduce, and new workloads such as streaming data, interactive queries, and machine learning. This versatility makes Spark a powerful tool for handling large-scale data processing tasks in a distributed computing environment. I glanced at the official website and then I will install.

```shell
brew install hadoop
```

During the installation process, I will learn about it. Apache Hadoop is a framework for processing large data sets in a distributed manner across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each providing local computation and storage. Instead of relying on hardware for high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may experience failures. To update Homebrew, first run:
Fetching latest Homebrew changes:
  git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
  git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask fetch --unshallow
These commands may take a few minutes to run due to the large size of the repositories.

Translation:
To update Homebrew, first run:
Fetching latest Homebrew core changes: git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
Fetching latest Homebrew cask changes: git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask fetch --unshallow
These commands may take a few minutes to run due to the large size of the repositories. This restriction has been imposed on GitHub's request as updating shallow clones is an expensive operation due to the tree layout and traffic of Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask. We don't perform this automatically to avoid repeatedly carrying out an expensive unshallow operation in CI systems (which should instead be fixed to not use shallow clones). Sorry for the inconvenience.

==> Caveats
==> openjdk
The OpenJDK Java runtime is required to run this formula.
Please install the OpenJDK formula (can be linked directly to the Homebrew version) before installing.

Or, if you prefer to install Oracle JDK, please install it from Oracle's website as Homebrew does not distribute Oracle JDK.

If you need to have only the Java runtime installed, please install the `openjdk-11` or `openjdk-15` package instead of this Maven formula. To make Java wrappers find this JDK, create a symlink:
sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

Note: openjdk is keg-only, so it wasn't symlinked into /usr/local, as it conflicts with macOS's `java` wrapper.

To make openjdk appear first in your PATH for executing Java commands, add this line to your .bash_profile:
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/lzw/.bash_profile

To enable compilers to find openjdk, you may need to set:
[environment variable]
JAVA_HOME="/usr/local/opt/openjdk"
[or]
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/local/opt/openjdk" Notice that `maven` was not linked properly in `brew`'s output log. Next, force link to version `3.6.3_1`.

```shell
  brew link --overwrite maven
```

1	dfsadmin What does this mean exactly? No worries, we have managed to get `Hadoop` running. And we have run the first single machine version of the computing example.

Back to Spark. Let's look at an example.

```python In this part, there is a reference to HDFS files. After looking it up, I found that you can create HDFS files as follows:

text_file = sc.textFile("hdfs://<HDFS_Namenode_address>:<HDFS_Port>/<path>")
# For example, "hdfs://namenode:50070/user/username/input"

counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) \
                 .map(lambda word: (word, 1)) \
                 .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

counts.saveAsTextFile("hdfs://<HDFS_Namenode_address>:<HDFS_Port>/<output_path>")
# For example, "hdfs://namenode:50070/user/username/output"
```

Here's the English translation of the code:

```python
text_file = sc.textFile("hdfs://<HDFS_Namenode_address>:<HDFS_Port>/<path>")
counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) \
                 .map(lambda word: (word, 1)) \
                 .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)
counts.saveAsTextFile("hdfs://<HDFS_Namenode_address>:<HDFS_Port>/<output_path>")
```

Replace `<HDFS_Namenode_address>`, `<HDFS_Port>`, `<path>`, and `<output_path>` with the appropriate values for your HDFS setup. Hdfs: usage: hdfs [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND [SUBCOMMAND_OPTIONS]

The following is the command to create a new directory in HDFS using the 'hdfs' command-line utility:

```shell
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /test
```

Translation:

Create directory in HDFS:
```
hdfs dfs -mkdir /test
``` OPTIONS can be none or any of:

--build-paths Try to add class files from build tree
--config-dir Hadoop config directory
--daemon (start|status|stop) Operate on a daemon
--debug Turn on shell script debug mode
--help Usage information
--hostnames list [of, host, names] Hosts to use in worker mode
--hosts file List of hosts to use in worker mode-- log level (specify level for log4j)
-- workers (enable worker mode)

SUBCOMMAND can be one of:

Admin Commands:

cacheadmin (configure HDFS cache)

Translation:

storage policies list get set satisfyStoragePolicy block storage policies
Client Commands:
classpath print the class path needed to get the Hadoop jar and the required libraries
dfs run a filesystem command on the file system
envvars display computed Hadoop environment variables
fetchdt fetch a delegation token from the NameNode

6. Run a portmap service
7. Run the DFS secondary namenode
8. Run external storage policies satisfier (sps)
9. Run the ZK Failover Controller daemon (zkfc) continued modifying the code.

SUBCOMMAND:
if len(sys.argv) <= 1:
print("Usage: SUBCOMMAND [options]")
sys.exit(1)

if sys.argv[1] == "-h":
print("Help for SUBCOMMAND:")
print("Usage: SUBCOMMAND [options]")
print("Options:")
print("-h, --help            show this help message and exit")
sys.exit(0)
```
This is the modified code for SUBCOMMAND. It will print help message when invoked without any parameters or with the "-h" option. From pyspark.sql import SparkSession

SparkSession object creation and configuration:

spark = SparkSession.builder \
.master("local[*]") \
.config("spark.driver.bindAddress", "127.0.0.1") \
.getOrCreate()

SparkContext object creation:
sc = spark.sparkContext

Text file processing:
text_file = sc.textFile("a.txt")

FlatMap operation: Splitting lines into words
counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))

Map operation: Creating tuples of words and their counts
counts = counts.map(lambda word: (word, 1)) notice that .config('spark.driver.bindAddress', '127.0.0.1') is important. Otherwise, an error will occur: "Service 'sparkDriver' could not bind on a random free port. You may check whether configuring an appropriate binding address"
The given Chinese text is not providing any Chinese characters or sentences that need to be translated into English. Instead, it is a comment in Python explaining the importance of setting the Spark driver bind address to '127.0.0.1' to avoid an error when running a Spark application. The English text itself is already in the desired format. However, an error occurred again.

PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3
```

Translation:
Modify `.bash_profile`:

```shell
PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3
PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3
``` Still encountering the same error. After understanding it in depth, it might be because `spark` was not loaded with this environment variable during runtime, not using the default environment variable from the terminal.

You need to set it in the code:

```python
import os

# Set spark environments
os.environ["SPARK_HOME"] = "/path/to/spark"
``` These lines set the environment variables for PySpark to use the specified Python interpreter:

os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3'
os.environ['PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON'] = '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3'

In English, the translation would be:

os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3'
os.environ['PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON'] = '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_6/bin/python3'
```

This will run.

This is the content of the file 'b.txt/part-00000'. It is a JSON file containing an array of objects, each representing a person with an id, name, age, and city. two things worked on of college, writing, programming. Didn't worked on of school (eight times). Didn't didn't. probably are short, awful. They plot, just characters, them them.

Translation:

They are probably short and awful. They plot, just characters, them them.

So the English translation without any Chinese characters or punctuation would be:

They are probably short awful. They plot just characters them them.: Success! Does this ring a bell. This is similar to the `Hadoop` example.

```shell
$ cat output/*
1	dfsadmin
```

Translation:
Success! Is this familiar? This is similar to the Hadoop example.

```shell
$ cat output/*
1	dfsadmin
``` These files are called `HDFS`. Here, `Spark` is used to count words. A few simple sentences, quite convenient.

Next, let's play around with `Kubernetes`, also known as `k8s`, where the eight characters in the middle are abbreviated as 8. It is a suite of open-source tools for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. `kubectl` is a command-line tool used to run commands on a K8s cluster. It can be used to deploy applications, view and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

Similarly, it can be installed using Homebrew.

brew install kubectl

[For Flink, there is no provided Chinese text in the input.] Flink is for stateful stream processing. What does stateful mean? I'm not clear yet. The picture above is quite interesting. Let's try to figure it out.

Yes, I've got it. It's similar to `Spark`.

## Kylin

(Note: The given Chinese text seems to be incomplete as it contains extra "Yes, I've got it." which doesn't seem to fit the context.) Open the official website.

Apache Kylin is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse for Big Data. It was designed to provide OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) capability in the big data era. By renovating the multi-dimensional cube and precalculation technology on Hadoop and Spark, Kylin can achieve near constant query speed regardless of the ever-growing data volume. It reduces query latency from minutes to sub-second, bringing online analytics back to big data.1. Identify Star/Snowflake Schema on Hadoop.
2. Build Cube from identified tables.
3. Query using ANSI-SQL and get results in sub-second, via ODBC, JDBC or RESTful API.

Apache Kylin lets you query billions of rows at sub-second latency in 3 steps:

1. Identify a Star/Snowflake Schema on Hadoop.
2. Build Cube from the identified tables.
3. Query using ANSI-SQL and get results in sub-second, through ODBC, JDBC or RESTful API.Approximately a layer for analyzing big data. It can be very fast with it. Acts as a bridge.

Unfortunately, it can only be used in a `Linux` environment currently. I'll come back to experiment later.

## MongoDB This is also a database. Give it a try and install.

In English, the given Chinese text translates to:

- _id: "6049ef91b653541cf355facb",
- item: "canvas",
- qty: 100,
- tags: ["cotton"],
- size: { h: 28, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" } Lastly, let's come back to this. Later, we'll move on to other tools. The significance of what we're doing is roughly to establish a framework. Starting anything is difficult, and we've gone through all of these things from the beginning. This gives us confidence, and next, we'll continue to tinker with these software.

## Practice

Practice:
Establishing a framework gives confidence, and continuing to tinker with software builds upon that foundation. Students explore similarly as shown above.
