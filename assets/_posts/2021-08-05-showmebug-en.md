title: "A Presentation at a Startup - Something I Enjoyed"
---

I made a presentation at ShowMeBug in August 2021. The topic was about something I enjoyed. You can find the slides on [GitHub](https://github.com/lzwjava/Keynotes/blob/master/ShowMeBug/20210805lzw.pdf).

I shared details about an electronic project, Kindle techniques, and the blog of Yin Wang, as well as my English study.
