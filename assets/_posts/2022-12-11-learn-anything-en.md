How to learn anything in a year? Let's take English as an example. I spent one year to achieve IELTS 6 score and be able to use English to work fluently in a global big company. Here is my way.

1. Trust yourself. You are a genius. Everyone is a genius.

2. Find the real expert on the Internet. They really know, and they share a lot, Like the teacher Yin Wang.

3. Find a lot of interesting materials on the Internet. Like Youtube, Bilibili, Tiktok, Douyin, Tencent Video, WeChat Channels, Twitter, Google. 

4. Start small. You can watch any short videos or long videos as long as they have English.

5. Step by Step. If you don't know English at all, please learn the basic alphabet and 100 simple words for your first two months.

6. 16 hours to learn. If you are able to use a mobile phone, then use it. If you can't, then listen with a Bluetooth earphone or speaker. Listen when driving. Listen when taking care of your baby. Listen when cooking. Listen when falling asleep.

7. Go crazy. Then you can't leave English for one second. You must ensure you have some English materials to listen to as long as you are awake.

8. Know yourself and keep focus. Let the voices of English float around your ears, you will be naturally focusing time by time. When I drive for 2 hours, I must be able to listen carefully for 1 hour.

9. Take exams and then know your limit. Though my IELTS 6 score is good, However, most graduate programs of the top 50 universities in the world need IELTS 6.5 or 7. So be humble.

10. Polish your ability. Write down what you hear using a computer. Just write some notes and some words instead of whole articles. So it's easy. No dictation software can be better than this way. And write down what you want to share, and share them with your friends.

11. Keep finding ways to learn interestingly. Like using DeepL to translate or Grammarly to check your grammar. Like finding foreign friends to talk to online. Like using simple English words to chat with your Chinese friend on WeChat.

12. The ultimate way is using English to think all the time. Talk to yourself in English all the time.  

13. Everything can be learned in this way. Think in math, speak in Math, write in math, listen in math, read in math. 

14. And then you find that you don't need to learn, you just live with it. It is your soulmate, then you live all the time with your soulmate.
