### My Experience with Macau SIM Cards

During my weekend visit to Macau in 2023, I bought a China Telecom Easy+ SIM Macau Card. After arriving in Guangzhou, I found it still worked perfectly, helping me learn English and download many foreign apps. It felt like I was still in Macau. I highly recommend it. Later, I tried the Blue Macau SIM Card, which was also good. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of both:
