### Introduction

In the world of cloud computing, Microsoft Azure stands out as a robust platform for building, deploying, and managing applications. In our recent project, we leveraged several Azure services, including Azure Subscription, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Application Insights, Virtual Machines (VMs), Event Hubs, API Management Services, and SQL Databases to create a scalable and monitored application infrastructure. This blog post outlines our approach, tools used, best practices, and detailed steps for managing clusters, fetching logs, and querying logs.

### Getting Started with Azure Subscription

An Azure Subscription is your gateway to accessing Azure services. It acts as a container that holds all your resources, such as virtual machines, databases, and Kubernetes clusters.

1. Setting Up Azure Subscription:
   - Sign Up: If you don't have an Azure account, start by signing up at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Create a Subscription: Navigate to the "Subscriptions" section and create a new subscription. This will be your billing and management container.

2. Resource Organization:
   - Resource Groups: Organize your resources into resource groups based on their lifecycle and management criteria.
   - Tags: Use tags for additional metadata and easier resource management and billing.

### Deploying Applications with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

#### Creating and Managing an AKS Cluster

1. Creating an AKS Cluster in the Azure Portal:
   - Setup: In the Azure portal, search for AKS and create a new Kubernetes cluster.
   - Configuration: Choose your cluster size, configure node pools, and set up networking.
   - Authentication: Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for secure access control.
   - Monitoring: Enable monitoring and logging during the setup process.

2. Creating an AKS Cluster with Azure CLI:
   ```sh
   az aks create \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --name myAKSCluster \
     --node-count 3 \
     --enable-addons monitoring \
     --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

3. Managing Your AKS Cluster:
   - Scaling the Cluster:
     ```sh
     az aks scale \
       --resource-group myResourceGroup \
       --name myAKSCluster \
       --node-count 5
     ```
   - Upgrading the Cluster:
     ```sh
     az aks upgrade \
       --resource-group myResourceGroup \
       --name myAKSCluster \
       --kubernetes-version 1.21.2
     ```

#### Deploying Applications

1. Using Kubernetes Manifests: Write YAML files for your deployments, services, and other Kubernetes objects.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
