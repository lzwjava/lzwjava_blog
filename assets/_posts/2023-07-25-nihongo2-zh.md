Let's continue to learn the Japenese Song "Mayonaka no door".

The rest lyrics are:
     
恋と愛とは 違うものだよと     
昨夜言われた そんな気もするわ     
二度目の冬が来て     
離れていった貴方の心     
ふり返ればいつも     
そこに 貴方を感じていたの     
Stay with me...     
真夜中のドアをたたき     
心に穴があいた     
あの季節が 今 目の前     
Stay with me...     
淋しさまぎらわして     
置いたレコードの針     
同じメロディ 繰り返していた...     
Stay with me...     
真夜中のドアをたたき     
帰らないでと泣いた     
あの季節が 今 目の前     
Stay with me...     
口ぐせを言いながら     
二人の瞬間を抱いて     
まだ忘れず 暖めてた     
Stay with me...     
真夜中のドアをたたき     
帰らないでと泣いた     
あの季節が 今 目の前

Zhiwei: Could you explain "恋と愛とは 違うものだよと "?

ChatGPT: Sure! The phrase "恋と愛とは違うものだよ" is Japanese and it can be translated into English as "Love and affection are different things."

Here's the breakdown of the phrase:

- 恋 (こい, koi) refers to romantic love or being in love. It often describes the passionate and intense feelings between two people who are attracted to each other.

- 愛 (あい, ai) refers to love in a broader sense, encompassing affection, care, and deep emotional attachment. It can be used to describe love between family members, friends, or even a general sense of love for humanity.

- と (to) is a particle in Japanese that functions as a conjunction, connecting the two nouns "恋" (love) and "愛" (affection) to the verb "違う" (ちがう, chigau) which means "to be different."

- 違う (ちがう, chigau) means "to be different" or "to differ."

- もの (mono) means "thing."

- だ (da) is a copula in Japanese used to indicate a state or to equate things.

- よ (yo) is an ending particle that adds emphasis to the statement. It's like saying "you know" or "I'm telling you."

So, when put together, the phrase can be translated as "Love and affection are different things, you know." It emphasizes that there's a distinction between the passionate feelings of romantic love (恋) and the broader, caring, and emotional attachment of love (愛).
