## Quick Take

* We want to make a computer to do machine learning. We buy the recent and affordable components until 2023 to build.
* We buy components like Intel Core i9-13900KF, MSI MAG B760M Mortar Motherboard and MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card, etc.
* The computer couldn't start up. We asked an expert for help two times. One is that the motherboard power supply connector is loose. The other reason is that the front panel start button connector is loose.
* We don't need to buy vertical GPU brackets in our case. We should carefully analyze the reason instead of buying extra components for a quick solution.
* We should make cables place on the other side of the computer case. So the cables will not cover the motherboard and we can see it clearly.
* We should focus more on the compatibility between the components, especially between the motherboard, PC case, power supply and other components. They interact with other components a lot.

## Principles

* Compare globally, like JD.com China, Rakuten Japan, Amazon USA
* Amazon has great tables to compare the products in the same series
* Find the best introduction to learn, check out negative comments
* Focus on two expensive items, CPU and GPU
* What is the biggest possible mistake of the buying decision?
* Go to the website of the manufacturer to check the details
* Check the compatibility of the items
* For the specifications of items, we will get familiar with them in the journey
* We can jump between the website and reference links to learn
* By working out a final plan, we can know more and figure out the critical questions
* Buy the best and latest products whose price you can afford.

## Reference

Learn about the different Intel Cores.

Ask ChatGPT: 

What is the difference between P-cores and E-cores in Intel CPU?

What's the difference between i9 and i7? 

If I want to do machine learning, which I should buy, the i7 or i9?

i9 13900

https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i9-13900-vs-Intel-Core-i9-13900F/m1977296vsm1994287

---

What does F mean in Intel processor?

If your Intel® Core™ Desktop Processor includes the letter F in the product line suffix, then you need to use a discrete graphics card in your system. If the integrated graphics port is used instead, the processor will not boot.

---

Is Intel K or F better?

If your Intel processor has a K, that means that it is able to be overclocked and has been unlocked. F means that there is no iGPU or integrated graphics for the processor. KF series processors tend to be cheaper than K processors and usually have no iGPU.

## Reflection

We should make cables place on the other side of the computer case. So the cables will not cover the motherboard and we can see it clearly.

We should ask customer support for the products in advance to gain all useful information, like installation videos. They prefer to upload long videos on large video platforms instead of showing them on e-commerce platforms.

We ask an expert two times to check why our computer couldn't start up. One is that the motherboard power supply connector is loose. The other reason is that the front panel start button connector is loose.

When we ask specialists to help us, we need to do it ourselves to learn. They should only guide us. Otherwise, we will easily forget and don't know what to do when facing problems next time. 

We don't need to buy vertical GPU Brackets in our case, like this [one](https://a.co/d/1ieE5kd). We should carefully analyze instead of buying extra components for a quick solution.

We should focus more on the compatibility between the components, especially between the motherboard, PC case, power supply and other components. They interact with other components a lot.

## Update

I regret not opting for a larger graphics card, as 12 GB of VRAM has proven insufficient for my needs.
