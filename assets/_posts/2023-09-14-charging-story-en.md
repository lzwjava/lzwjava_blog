title: "Battling Charging Problems with My Electric Car"
---

I fully charged my car in Zogang, which has a range of 400km on a full charge. I began my drive to Markam, a distance of about 160km. At that point, the car displayed a remaining range of around 250km.

This seemed good, especially considering that Zogang is at a higher altitude than Markam. The car was descending the mountain, which usually helps conserve energy.

I remembered this because last week, when I drove from Markam to Zogang, my car stopped about 30km from Zogang. The display showed that I could still travel 280km, but in reality, I had only driven about 130km.

As we started climbing the mountain this time, I noticed the battery level dropping rapidly. I thought, "This isn’t good." However, I hoped we’d soon start descending, and I was right. But as night fell, the temperature dropped to around 5°C, and the battery drained even faster due to the cold.

It became clear that climbing uphill was the primary cause of rapid battery drain.

So, my car didn't make it to Zogang last week, and I had to call a tow truck for assistance.

When I drove back from Zogang to Markam, I kept that lesson in mind. Upon arriving in Markam, I headed straight to the Kewang charging station, which I had used many times during my journey to Tibet. However, the station was having issues at that moment, displaying a "data handshake timeout" error.

I asked the hotel clerk to restart the charging station, but the issue persisted.

I then drove to the Markam Yunqu Manor Hotel, which had only Xiaopeng charging stations, seemingly exclusive to Xiaopeng cars. Although Kewang claimed to have charging stations there, I couldn’t find any.

Frustrated, I continued my journey, but eventually, the battery ran out completely, and I was unable to charge it.

I tried all possible ways to resolve the issue, but nothing worked. I went to the hotel, and the next day, after consulting Neta customer support, we opened the front cover, manually disconnected the battery, and reconnected it to reset the system. Fortunately, this allowed the car to charge again.
