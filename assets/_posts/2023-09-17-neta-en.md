# Restarting Your Electric Vehicle to Solve System Issues

Just like resolving computer crashes or phone lags, restarting can resolve most issues. Pure electric vehicles can be viewed as large electronic devices, with all electronic systems and the main power supply managed by a small battery in the engine compartment.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Restart Your Electric Vehicle

### 1. Disconnect the Small Battery

First, you need to use a wrench to disconnect the negative terminal of the small battery. This small battery is responsible for supplying power to all electronic systems and the main unit of your vehicle.

### 2. Wait for 5 Minutes

Keep the negative terminal disconnected for about 5 minutes. This allows the vehicle's onboard system to be completely powered off, ensuring a full reset.

### 3. Reconnect the Battery

After waiting, tighten the negative terminal of the small battery back in place. This restores the power supply to the vehicle's electronic systems.

### 4. Restart the Vehicle

With the battery reconnected, the vehicle's system can be considered "restarted." All settings and detections will be restored to their initial values. Now, try starting the vehicle again. In most cases, this should resolve any issues, and your vehicle should start up smoothly.

## Specific Case: Neta V Chao 400 Lite

For instance, the Neta V Chao 400 Lite might encounter a situation where it cannot charge when the battery is at 0%. In such cases, performing the steps mentioned above can help reset the system. This method ensures that all electronic systems are rebooted, potentially resolving the charging issue.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can effectively restart your electric vehicle, similar to rebooting a computer or smartphone. This method can resolve many system issues, ensuring that your vehicle runs smoothly. Always keep safety in mind and, if you're unsure, consult your vehicle's manual or seek professional help.
