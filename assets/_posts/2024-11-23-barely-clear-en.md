title: "Natural Vision Restoration: The Principle of \"Just Barely Clear\""
---

### Abstract

This paper discusses a key discovery in the process of myopia reversal: the principle of "just barely clear" vision. By examining the impact of slightly reduced prescriptions that make objects just barely clear at typical viewing distances, the paper explores how this principle facilitates natural vision restoration. The paper highlights the importance of the specific reduction for different individuals and provides a framework for how to implement this strategy effectively. Furthermore, it delves into personal experiences and experiments conducted over the course of several years.

### Introduction

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common refractive error where distant objects appear blurry due to the elongation of the eyeball. Traditionally, corrective lenses are prescribed to bring objects into focus, but the concept of myopia reversal—restoring the eye’s natural shape to reduce dependence on corrective lenses—is gaining interest. This paper presents a novel principle discovered during myopia reversal efforts: wearing glasses that make objects "just barely clear" at typical viewing distances, rather than adhering to a fixed degree reduction. 

The "just barely clear" principle offers a more personalized approach to myopia reversal, emphasizing gradual improvement without straining the eyes. The paper will examine this principle, provide methods for its application, and discuss the impact it has had on the author’s own experience with myopia reduction.

### Methodology

The author has conducted personal experiments over the course of several years, tracking the reduction of myopia and evaluating the effects of different levels of prescription reduction. Using a variety of corrective lenses with reductions ranging from 150 to 200 degrees, the author tracked changes in vision clarity at typical viewing distances, such as for mobile phone use and computer work.

The methodology includes:  
1. Wearing corrective lenses with varying degrees of reduction.  
2. Monitoring vision clarity during daily activities.  
3. Noting improvements or stagnation in myopia and astigmatism.  
4. Analyzing the experience and correlating it with the relevant theory in myopia reversal.

### Personal Experience with the "Just Barely Clear" Principle

I would like to share a significant personal experience that underscores the importance of the “just barely clear” principle in the process of myopia reversal. During the first year of implementing this method, my myopia was reduced by approximately 100 degrees, which was a promising outcome. However, in the subsequent year, I observed little to no further improvement. Upon reflecting on this stagnation, I was able to identify the likely cause:

In the first year, my primary activity involved computer work, during which I wore glasses with a 150-degree reduction. This setup allowed me to frequently experience the "just barely clear" state, where vision was sufficiently clear without being overly sharp. However, in the second year, as I shifted my focus to studying for my associate degree at home, I reduced my computer usage and primarily relied on my mobile phone for reading materials and exercises.

This change in my daily habits led me to revisit the work of Yin Wang, particularly the following passage, which proved to be a turning point in my understanding:

> When looking at distant objects, the crystalline lens needs to relax and reduce refraction. If the image still falls in front of the retina after the lens is completely relaxed, objects appear blurry. If you continue to look at the object in this state, the external eye muscles will begin to gently compress the eyeball, making the optical axis slightly shorter (perhaps only 0.x millimeters), and the blurry object will gradually become somewhat clearer. If you frequently maintain this slightly blurry state, the repeated small compressions of the optical axis will lead to permanent shortening, and myopia will reverse.

This passage clarified the underlying mechanism by which the optical axis may shorten through gradual, repeated compression. Based on this understanding, I experimented with glasses offering 175- and 200-degree reductions, which provided a greater opportunity for the “just barely clear” state. I am hopeful that this adjustment will lead to a further reduction in my myopia by approximately 100 degrees over the course of the next year.

From this experience, I have learned that the key to effective myopia reversal lies not in adhering to a fixed degree of reduction, but in consistently maintaining the "just barely clear" state. The specific degree of reduction required to achieve this state will vary for each individual, but the critical factor is identifying and sustaining this optimal point of clarity, which facilitates the gradual adaptation necessary for myopia reduction.


### Results

Over the course of experimentation, the following key results were observed:

1. Initial Findings: In the first year of using the “just barely clear” method, the author’s myopia reduced by approximately 100 degrees. However, the second year showed minimal progress, prompting a deeper analysis of the approach.
   
2. The "Just Barely Clear" State: The following characteristics were defined for the "just barely clear" state:
   - Objects should be sufficiently clear to view without straining.
   - Text should be readable, but not completely crisp.
   - The eyes should feel relaxed, not engaged in heavy focusing efforts.

3. Personal Experience with Prescription Reductions:
   - For mobile phone use, a reduction of 175-200 degrees achieved the "just barely clear" state.
   - For computer use, a reduction of 150 degrees typically suffices.
   - A general rule was found where the "just barely clear" state encourages gradual improvement without forcing excessive clarity.

4. The Importance of Gradual Reduction: The optimal reduction varies between individuals, but the key takeaway is that forcing clarity too early or with too large a reduction can hinder natural adaptation and improvement. The author’s experience suggests that moving to stronger reductions too quickly can result in stagnation, which led to the realization that the "just barely clear" state is crucial for continued myopia reversal.

5. Personal Experience with Vision Restoration: Through the gradual reduction of prescriptions over time, the author noticed steady improvements in vision clarity, with a key focus on maintaining a relaxed eye state rather than pushing for immediate clarity.

### Discussion

The concept of "just barely clear" vision has proven crucial in natural vision restoration. Unlike the conventional approach of prescribed reductions based on specific degree reductions, this approach emphasizes gradual adaptation. The reduction does not need to follow a fixed number of degrees, but instead focuses on finding the threshold where objects are visible without excessive strain.

This concept aligns with the theory that myopia is the result of optical deformation, and by encouraging the eyes to work slightly harder to focus, the optical axis is gradually shortened, reversing myopia. The experience underscores the importance of balance in vision clarity—too much clarity results in less stimulation for the eyes to adapt, while too little clarity can lead to strain.

An interesting point is that for individuals with varying severities of myopia and astigmatism, the reduction process may take different forms. More severe myopia may see faster progress, while less pronounced myopia may require more time to yield visible results.

### Conclusion

This study highlights the significance of the "just barely clear" principle in myopia reversal. Rather than focusing on a fixed number of degrees of reduction, this principle emphasizes the importance of finding a personalized threshold of clarity that encourages the eye to adapt without straining. The author’s experiments suggest that gradual, consistent reduction in prescription, adjusted according to individual needs, is more effective than adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach. This research suggests a promising method for natural vision restoration and opens the door for further investigation into individualized myopia reversal techniques.
