Below is my assoiciate progress. 

Guangdong University of Foreign Studiesï¼ŒComputer Application, Associate Degree, 2022.10 - Present

* National Higher Education Self-study Examination. Passed 7 courses as of today, Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Data Structures, Advanced Language Programming (I), English (I), Advanced Mathematics, Database and Applications, Computer Application Technology.
* Currently preparing for 9 courses such as Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Networks, Basic Electronic Technology (III), Microcomputer and Interface Technology, College Chinese, Mao Zedong Thought and Theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, and Ideological and Moral Cultivation and Legal Basics, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Law.

I am unhappy about my progress. It is slow. The reason is that I mainly prepare it for one year until now.

## Reasons for passing courses
* Already had good understanding before the exam, like Introduction to Data Structures and English
* Prepared well enough in the past year, like Advanced Mathematics and Database Applications

## Reasons for failed courses
* Thought that I had already prepared well, but actually hadn't. The exercises I did for the failed subjects were apparently fewer than for the passed courses. 
* Did not give enough time to prepare
* Just walked through videos of the subjects pretending to understand.

## Exam preparation
* Sleep well, maintain a good routine for sleep
* Morning and afternoon exams may be in different locations, check the right locations
* Register for the exam on time
