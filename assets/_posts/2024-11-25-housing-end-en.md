title: "The End of the Housing Dream"
---

The reality of the housing market hit home when my family's investment in Guangzhou turned bitter. We purchased a house for 2 million CNY in 2022, only to watch its value plummet to 1 million CNY by 2024. This isn't just a story of numbers â€“ it's a reflection of a shifting global paradigm.

The traditional wisdom of "property never loses value" lies shattered. This decline isn't isolated to China; housing markets worldwide are experiencing unprecedented corrections. But perhaps this correction was inevitable. In our current era, dominated by information technology and knowledge-based economies, the fundamentals of real estate seem increasingly antiquated.

Construction isn't primarily about technological innovation. Instead, it remains entrenched in a complex web of land policies, management hierarchies, and government controls. This traditional model feels increasingly at odds with our rapidly digitalizing world.

What's truly fascinating is the evolution in people's mindsets. We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how individuals assess value. In this AI-driven, knowledge-focused era, people are beginning to question long-held assumptions about wealth and investment. Their eyes are opening to new possibilities, and they're reconsidering what truly matters in this changing landscape.

The death of the traditional housing market might just be the birth of a new understanding of value in our digital age.
