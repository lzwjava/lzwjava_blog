* Treat learning as a hobby by approaching with playfulness and genuine interest.

* Learn through practice and repetition until mastery comes through hands-on experience.

* Use daily immersion by engaging with the subject regularly in natural contexts.

* Follow your genuine interests because passion leads to better learning outcomes.

* Draw from multiple sources whenever you need simpler explanations.

* Persist through difficulties by taking breaks and seeking inspiration from peers.

* Maintain consistent engagement instead of relying on cramming sessions.

* Create opportunities to actively apply what you're learning.

* Make learning practical by connecting it to real-life applications.

* Remember that learning comes naturally through play and exploration.

* Learn with AI tools, ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini.

* Use multiple languages to ask AI tools questions.

* Use YouTube, YouTube shorts or TikTok to search for video explanations.

* Download YouTube courses to listen to while driving, try to recall or imagine what you listen to.

* Emotions come and go - when you can't focus, try using other ways to learn, or do something else, then come back.

* It is ok to not fully understand a question or paragraph in one go - just skip it and try to understand it next time, or the time after that.

* In school, I learned by listening to teachers and doing exercises. After leaving school, I learned by doing work, projects and pursuing hobbies. Reflect on how you learned things in the past. Use those methods to learn current matters.

* Action produces information. Just move forward to learn new things.

* Take exams, interviews, certificates, finish tasks to achieve excellence.

* Do not just watch videos of the subjects pretending to understand.

* Most of the time you think you have already prepared well, but actually haven't. Aim high to achieve middle results. Aim for middle to achieve low results.

* Sleep well. Take naps if tired.

* Attitude or motivation is hard to lie to yourself about. Follow your true passion.

* Environment is important. You don't need to learn English hard if you grow up in English-speaking countries.

* Your brain is powerful. Think things through by yourself. Think again and again, time after time.

* Grab the essence or principle of things to learn. For example, machine learning is about calculus, and startups are about making something people want.

* You don't need to learn something to prove yourself to others. New discoveries take time to become popular. Your abilities take time to become truly good. Others will then notice.

* Learning is mainly about trying new things or thinking in new ways. Keep exploring.

* To learn is to better enjoy life. For example, learning a new language is like opening a new world. 

* When learning a subject, directly approaching the core concepts or doing the final exam exercises is okay. You can learn backward to the fundamental things. A hard start leads to an easy end. Quickly overcome the fear or discomfort associated with new knowledge. 

* Teach or share what you learn to others, one piece at a time. No matter how technical or sophisticated it is, share it with your companion, friends, or even street buddies. 

* Write blogs, make videos, or create other content to share. People are narcissistic. By reviewing what you create, you will notice imperfections. That will give you the urge to improve.
