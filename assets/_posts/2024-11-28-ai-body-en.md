title: "Predict Next Body States Like Predicting the Next Token"
---

If we accumulate data about body state, such as the degree of myopia, weight, and all parameters of a normal physical examination, and then train an AI model on this data, we can predict future body states, similar to predicting the next token in a sequence.

We can also record information about the air we breathe, the food we eat, and how our bodies interact with the physical world to understand the causal relationships between these factors and health outcomes. For example, excessive sugar consumption can lead to diabetes.

This approach can help people live longer, healthier lives by enabling them to make informed decisions and take preventive measures.
