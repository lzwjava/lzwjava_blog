* The reason people worsen their eyesight is that they use glasses with full prescription (which lets them see a blackboard clearly at 5m) to look at phones, computers, or books most of the time. This causes their eyeballs to deform.

* After using glasses with a 150-200 degree reduction for several days, you won't want to go back to full prescription glasses. The latter becomes very uncomfortable.

* Understanding myopia is key - it's caused by eye muscle changes, not just genetics or light exposure.

* The most important principle is "just barely clear" - wear glasses that make things just clear enough without straining.

* For computer or phone use, a 150-200 degree reduction often works well.

* Keep a stronger prescription pair for driving and essential tasks requiring perfect vision.

* Expect slow progress - about 25 degrees reduction every three months is good.

* Don't aim for perfect clarity. Slightly blurry vision is part of the improvement process.

* Use the formula: Myopia degree = 100/clear distance (in meters) for rough assessment.

* Don't force yourself to see clearly - let your eyes adjust naturally.

* Learn about your eye mechanics - understanding how external eye muscles work helps make better vision choices.

* Myopia requires wearing glasses, which can be troublesome during activities like playing basketball or when wearing a hat. The hat cannot stretch to cover more skin and provide warmth because the glasses take up space. Forgetting to wear glasses also affects vision.

* While some people may feel too old or lazy to address their myopia, it's crucial to take action for the sake of future generations to prevent the same challenges.

* The improvement process takes time - myopia developed over years will take time to improve.
