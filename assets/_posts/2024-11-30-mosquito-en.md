title: "Mosquitoes Disappear When Temperature Drops"
---

In last night, I intened to go to sleep. At the moment I want to close the mosquito net, I found there wasn't any mosquito in my room now. The winter is coming. Today is Nov 30, 2024. I am in Guangzhou, China. The temperature in Guangzhou is between 13-20°C.

Then I asked the Claude to explain how's the behavior of mosquitoes when the temperature drops. I got the following answer.

When the temperature drops below certain levels, mosquitoes become less active. Specifically:

- Around 18°C (64°F): Mosquito activity begins to slow down
- Below 15°C (59°F): Mosquitoes have difficulty flying and finding food
- Below 10°C (50°F): Most mosquitoes will either enter dormancy or die

This happens because mosquitoes are cold-blooded animals, and their body temperature changes with the environment. When it's too cold, their metabolism slows down and they cannot maintain normal activity.

The ideal temperature for mosquito breeding is between 25-28°C (77-82°F). That's why we see fewer mosquitoes during autumn and winter as temperatures drop.

However, it's worth noting that some mosquito species have adapted to lower temperatures and can survive in cold weather. Especially in indoor environments with heating, mosquitoes may still remain active.

So I don't need to close the mosquito net to avoid mosquitoes. And my small electric mosquito lamp can shut down now.
