I bought an electric hair clipper from JD.com in 2019. I have been using this product for some time. I use it to cut my hair about half the time, and go to a barber shop the other half.

The clipper works well overall. However, cutting the lowest part of the hair at the back of my head is challenging. I tried the solutions shown below, but they failed because they made the process too complicated.

I developed a new method. While not perfect, it works well enough for me.

First, I use a 13mm clipper head to cut my entire head of hair. Then, I switch to a 5mm clipper head for the lowest part at the back. But how do you control the clipper to only cut that lowest section?

You need to use it like a shovel. Place the clipper head at the lowest part of your head and move it back and forth.

It's somewhat difficult to explain in words - you'll need to try it yourself. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, requiring no additional tools.
