Normally, when you use a quilt to cover your body in winter, your shoulders and neck will be exposed. I found a solution - using a shawl to cover them. One reason is that due to the length of the quilt, if you pull it up to your neck, the lower part will be exposed and your feet may feel cold. Another reason is that a shawl is relatively thin and light, making it easy to fill up the space between your body and the quilt.

At first, I bought a shawl two months ago to cover my stomach while sleeping in autumn. Now that winter is coming, I can use it in this way.
