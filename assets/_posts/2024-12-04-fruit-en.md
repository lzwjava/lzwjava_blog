title: "Eat Fruits Instead Of Snacks"
---

I remember between 2016 and 2018, my weight quickly increased from 70kg to 90kg. At that time, I ordered fast food from delivery apps almost every day. And sometimes, while working late into the night, I ate a lot of snacks in the office.

After returning to Guangzhou from Beijing in early 2020, I ate foods that were made by my parents. But sometimes, I still ate snacks. And I didn't maintain the practice of playing basketball. I played basketball a lot from late 2020 to early 2021. But later, I changed that habit to walking while listening to English podcasts. And starting from September 2023, I started to play basketball again.

I should start eating more fruits. If I am hungry sometimes, I should eat fruits instead of snacks.
