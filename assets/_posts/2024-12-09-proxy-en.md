* To set up a server, use Outline Manager: [https://getoutline.org](https://getoutline.org).
* Recommended hosting providers: DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Amazon Lightsail, Azure, Vultr, or Linode. Prefer regions in Singapore or Tokyo. Avoid the Hong Kong region as tools like ChatGPT and Claude are banned there.
* Both Shadowsocks and VMess protocols can easily get banned. Use Linode for fast IP migration or set up a new server with Outline Manager using the Shadowsocks protocol.
* On iOS, use Shadowrocket with Shadowsocks rules: [https://github.com/Johnshall/Shadowrocket-ADBlock-Rules-Forever](https://github.com/Johnshall/Shadowrocket-ADBlock-Rules-Forever). Configure global routing to separate China traffic from overseas traffic.
* On Android, use V2Ray.
* On Fire TV, use the V2Ray app.
* On Apple TV, use the Shadowrocket app.
* On Mac, use ShadowsocksX-NG app.
* Optionally, get a China Macao SIM card to use cellular data directly when needed. https://www.1888.com.mo/
* If the proxy server gets banned by the GFW or encounters other issues, we can use a China Telecom Macau SIM card to share cellular data with the laptop. This enables the use of Outline Manager to set up a new server.
* For cloud services like Google Cloud Platform, Outline Manager requires an existing proxy server to configure a new one. However, other providers like DigitalOcean or Vultr can be set up directly without the need for a proxy server.
* Switch the App Store to the USA region, turn on a proxy (USA) globally, then it will show the payment option of "None," allowing you to switch openly.
* Use a Visa card to buy gift cards from Amazon, or use the Apple gift card portal to charge your App Store account.
