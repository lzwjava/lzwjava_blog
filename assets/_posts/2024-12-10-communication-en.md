title: "The Best Communication Method for Me"
---

* Share what I want to say in a blog.

* Like [https://www.yinwang.org](https://www.yinwang.org), share the long-term truths, interesting, and novel lessons in the blog.

* Do not share on WeChat, Weibo, or LinkedIn. Just let people connected there find you through signature or a short bio.

* I am an independent thinker and have a lot of unconventional ideas. I don't want to persuade others.

* I don't want to be someone who seeks recognition anymore. Living in those places made me docile and conformable.

* Use Twitter to share blog update posts to notify close readers.

* Prefer to communicate one-to-one in ways that can be traced over the years. Use text messages instead of calling, as many platforms do not provide an option to generate transcripts. This way, you can review past conversations to determine whose ideas or thoughts were better.
