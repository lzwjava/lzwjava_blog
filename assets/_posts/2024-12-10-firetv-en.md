title: "Using a Bluetooth Keyboard with Fire TV for Input"
---

I installed the V2ray application on my Fire TV. However, it is difficult to input or update the ShadowSocks URL directly on the Fire TV. The solution is to connect a Bluetooth keyboard.

By doing so, you can manually type long characters. However, it is easy to mistype the characters "I" (as in "IJK") and "l" (as in "lmn") because they look the same on the Fire TV. You can ask Gemini to identify the character for you.

And sometimes, the confirm button does not appear in the V2ray app. You need to restart the Fire TV to see it.
