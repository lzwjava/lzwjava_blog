* Explore the world early, go to different countries, and talk to different people.

* Read many books, especially non-fiction ones.

* Always think of better ways to do things.

* Think like a genius, suspect everything, especially authorities.

* Treat people equally. Be kind. Don't look down on people who are no better than you in terms of grades or salary. They didn't lie to you, trick you, or steal your money.

* Be careful of the powerful people behind the government. Some may hurt you from behind.

* If something happens, usually someone wants it to happen. Think hard about things that happen coincidentally or intentionally.

* Think hard about what is good or bad, and how everything gets invented or developed.

* Think about how to live in this world in the best ways.

* Get a lot of things that are free, such as free apps, books, and information. Enjoy air, sun, scenes, and water.

* Think hard about the rules. Figure out the original intention behind them. Ask yourself if the rules could be better or more detailed. Sometimes, we have to follow the rules. But do not let them limit your thinking.

* Treat everything as a learning experience. If it is good, it is nice. If it is bad, avoid it next time.

* Pursue truth. But be careful with science. Not all science is really true.

* Be safe. Health is the most important thing. Our body is really amazing.

* Eat natural or fresh things as much as possible. Eat fruits instead of snacks. Modern society invents too many foods. Prefer natural or less processed ones. Live long and explore more.

* Don't pursue miracles. Life itself is a miracle.

* Don't live for recognition or fame. We don't need recognition when we are born. We need security. Parents punish us when they don't approve of our behaviors. So gradually, we need recognition to get security. But those two are different things.

* It's okay to do anything as long as it doesn't involve or hurt anyone else.

* It's better to learn the truth first. So we don't need to change later.

* English is the world language now. Be good at it and use it like a native language.

* You don't need to change anyone. If you discover something or create something that people want, they will come.

* Don't get desperate. The majority of the world is helping. They are making products or providing services for cheap or free.

* When it comes to money, think about how the richest or smartest people do it.

* Normally, you can't force anyone to do anything, and others can't force you to do anything either.

* Follow your true passion. You can't force yourself to do things you don't like for a long time.

* You are upset that something doesn't work as expected. Just accept the facts or change your worldview to adapt to it. Learn from it.

* The good welfare of you depends yourself, your family, your company, your country. Comparing them wisely in the world. If they are all good, you will have good life. 

* Almost everything can be changed. Think about your nationality. Think about where you were born. Remove every limit and start thinking about how to have the best life in the world. Start to notice the big gap and work towards closing it.

* Humans are born to learn. If every piece of knowledge is taught correctly or you explore and reflect on it often, you will be happy to gain it.

* Think often about what Yin Wang or Daniel P. Friedman says. They are probably the smartest and kindest people in the world.

* The world will have more freedom. The world will become better as knowledge and technology evolve.
