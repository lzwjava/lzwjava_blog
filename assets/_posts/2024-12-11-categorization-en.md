title: "Categorization"
---

* Everything is about categorization.

* Design, software, products, physics, reversing myopia, startups, business, users, strategy, countries, programming languages, variables, and concepts are all about categorization.

* Categorization is a way of meta-thinking.

* By categorizing things into different groups, you can find better or more detailed solutions. It is like conditional branch code. It is like separating electronic components. It is like different network types.

* You can compare different things by categorizing them in different aspects.

* The number of groups and the standards for categorization are what we need to think about. It is like the conditions of a conditional block of code.

* If the conditions themselves have some patterns, we may use a switch statement. If the conditions are different from each other or have some special cases, we may use an if statement.

* Lambda code is really interesting. We may combine categorization with lambda code. Different groups of objects need different handling procedures.
