title: "Reasoning"
---

* Everything is about reasoning.

* Design, software, products, physics, reversing myopia, startups, business, users, strategy, countries, programming languages, variables, and concepts are all about reasoning.

* Reasoning is a way of meta-thinking.

* By reasoning about things, you understand how x changes y. Why values change from x to y, why people like or dislike products, why people pay attention to or ignore things.

* You can reason about things or behaviors, problems in different aspects, such as from first principles, human nature, or unknown causes, which we call mysteries.

* The ways of reasoning are what we need to think about. If something happens, we analyze it from the perspectives of time, space, environment, or the nature of objects.

* Things happen through some kind of form. It is like an operator in code.

* Every reason combined together may form a bigger reason. It is like lambda code. By combining functions, we can create a high-level function.
