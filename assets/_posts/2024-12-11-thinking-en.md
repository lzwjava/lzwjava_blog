* By categorizing, abstracting, or reasoning about things, you think.

* Systems thinking is about placing objects in a system map. You think about how things interact with each other, how the system works, and how abstraction and categorization function within the system.

* Critical thinking is about thinking objectively about the positives and negatives of things. You question everything around you to understand something.

* Creative thinking is about generating new ideas or concepts in a creative way. You may combine existing ideas or concepts directly or creatively. You may also combine two unrelated ideas or concepts to create new ones.

* Logical thinking is about thinking in a mathematical or programming way. We use structured, rational processes to analyze and solve problems.

* Experiential thinking is about reflecting on past experiences to solve new problems.

* Intuitive thinking is about thinking in an intuitive way. To have more accurate intuition, we need to explore or experience a lot.

* The timing of thinking matters. We may reflect on the problem after some weeks or months.

* We may collaborate with others or communicate with others to think.

* We may find or search for related information to think. Especially those ideas or opinions that are contrary to our own.

* We may record our thinking results. And we can reflect on them carefully after years.

* We may conduct more experiments to aid in thinking, just like fixing a bug.

* Avoid wishful thinking, as it often intertwines with oneâ€™s ego. We should separate our desires from the natural events or societal matters that are beyond our control.
