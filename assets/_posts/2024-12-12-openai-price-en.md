title: "Why ChatGPT Plus Should Charge by Token Usage"
---

ChatGPT Plus should transition to a flexible pricing model based on token usage rather than a fixed \\$20 monthly fee.

- Current Pricing: \\$20 per month.

### Proposal: Token-Based Pricing Model

1. GPT-4 API charges \\$2.50 per 1M input tokens and \\$10 per 1M output tokens. A similar usage-based model would be ideal for ChatGPT Plus users.
2. To overcome the limitations of iOS fixed-price subscriptions, OpenAI could implement a wallet system.
3. Users would deposit funds (e.g., \\$20), with token usage deducted either in real-time or daily. A minimum balance (e.g., \\$10) would be required to maintain uninterrupted service.

### Benefits:
- Flexibility: Low-usage users arenâ€™t overcharged, while high-usage users pay proportionally.
- Fairness: Users pay only for what they consume.
- Adaptability: Integrates seamlessly with existing subscription models.

With 300 million weekly users, shifting to this model could attract more subscribers. Based on a projected \\$11.6 billion revenue, around 48.33 million users are likely on the current \\$20/month plan.

This flexible pricing approach would offer a fairer, more customized experience for users.
