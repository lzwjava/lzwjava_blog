## Building a 2023 Machine Learning Computer

The project aimed to construct a machine learning-capable computer using up-to-date, budget-friendly components like an Intel Core i9-13900KF CPU, MSI B760M Mortar motherboard, and MSI RTX 4070 GPU. Startup issues were diagnosed and fixed by tightening loose connectors. The project underscored the importance of thorough troubleshooting, cable management for visibility, and ensuring component compatibility, especially among the motherboard, case, and power supply.
