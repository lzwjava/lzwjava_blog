Recently, I needed to update the links for my blog posts in a LaTeX document. With a growing number of posts, manually adding each link was tedious and error-prone. ChatGPT came to the rescue, making this process seamless and efficient.

---

### The Problem

I had a LaTeX document showcasing my Selected Blog Posts:

```latex
\cventry
    {Building a Scalable Application on Azure} % Blog title
    {Technical Blog} % Type
    {lzwjava.github.io} % Location
    {} % Date(s)
    {}
```

The placeholder lzwjava.github.io lacked specific URLs for each blog post.

The Solution

I provided ChatGPT with my blog titles and asked it to retrieve the links for each post and update the LaTeX code accordingly. Here’s an example of the ChatGPT prompt:

	“Retrieve links for these blog titles from my website and update the LaTeX code.”

ChatGPT returned the refined LaTeX snippet with correct hyperlinks:

```latex
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\cvsection{Selected Blog Posts}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cventries}

\cventry
    {Building a Scalable Application on Azure} % Blog title
    {Technical Blog} % Type
    {\href{https://lzwjava.github.io/azure-en}{lzwjava.github.io}} % Location
    {} % Date(s)
    {}

\cventry
    {Comprehensive Guide to Spring Framework} % Blog title
    {Technical Blog} % Type
    {\href{https://lzwjava.github.io/spring-en}{lzwjava.github.io}} % Location
    {} % Date(s)
    {}

\cventry
    {End-to-End Trace ID Implementation} % Blog title
    {Technical Blog} % Type
    {\href{https://lzwjava.github.io/trace-en}{lzwjava.github.io}} % Location
    {} % Date(s)
    {}

\end{cventries}
```

### The Result

With ChatGPT’s help:

1.	I quickly retrieved accurate blog post links.

2.	I updated my LaTeX document effortlessly, saving significant time and effort.

### Key Takeaway

This use case demonstrates how ChatGPT, combined with retrieval tools, can automate repetitive tasks like retrieving links or updating documents. Whether you’re working with LaTeX, Markdown, or other formats, ChatGPT can streamline your workflow effectively.
