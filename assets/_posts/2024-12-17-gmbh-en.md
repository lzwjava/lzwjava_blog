title: "GmbH, TeamViewer, Frankfurt Stock Exchange"
---

Recently, I've been learning more about Germany, thanks to an entrepreneurial friend from there. This sparked my curiosity to dive deeper into understanding the country’s business landscape and notable companies. At first, I didn't know why my friend's company had "GmbH" at the end of its name, and I didn't look it up immediately. A few days later, when I checked TeamViewer's Wikipedia page, I discovered that it is also a GmbH. So, I decided to ask ChatGPT to learn more.

## GmbH

GmbH stands for Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, which is a type of legal entity in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). It is equivalent to a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in English-speaking countries.

In short, GmbH is a popular business structure for small and medium-sized companies, offering flexibility in management while providing liability protection to its owners.

## TeamViewer

I remember using TeamViewer during my middle school years (2007-2013) to remotely control computers.

It is a German company, and the full name is TeamViewer SC. The company is traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. I decided to download the TradingView app to explore more about this market. I also checked Yahoo Finance to learn more about this market, even though I had already been familiar with Yahoo Finance for quite some time.

## Frankfurt Travel Guide

I installed the Frankfurt Travel Guide app and plan to keep it for a long time. It serves as a reminder on my phone that there is an amazing city I have yet to visit. There are many stories, people, and products to discover there.
