After exploring "Let Zsh Display Proxy Settings Before Running Network Commands," I delved deeper into Zsh hooks with ChatGPT. Hereâ€™s a concise overview for future reference.

In Zsh, hooks let you execute custom functions at specific points during shell operations. Beyond `preexec`, Zsh offers several hooks to enhance your environment:

### 1. `precmd`
- When: Before the prompt is displayed.
- Use: Update the prompt or perform cleanup.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  precmd() {
    echo "Ready for the next command!"
  }
  ```

### 2. `chpwd`
- When: When the current directory changes.
- Use: Update environment variables or trigger actions based on the directory.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  chpwd() {
    echo "Changed to: $PWD"
  }
  ```

### 3. `preexec_functions` & `precmd_functions`
- When: Similar to `preexec` and `precmd` but support multiple functions.
- Use: Attach multiple actions without overriding existing hooks.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  precmd_functions+=(additional_precmd)
  
  additional_precmd() {
    echo "Additional precmd task."
  }
  ```

### 4. `TRAPDEBUG`
- When: After each command, before results display.
- Use: Debugging, logging commands.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  TRAPDEBUG() {
    echo "Executed: $1"
  }
  ```

### 5. `TRAPEXIT`
- When: When the shell exits.
- Use: Cleanup tasks or display exit messages.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  TRAPEXIT() {
    echo "Goodbye!"
  }
  ```

### 6. `zle` Hooks
- When: During line editing.
- Use: Customize command line behavior.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  zle-line-init() {
    echo "Editing a new command."
  }
  zle -N zle-line-init
  ```

### 7. History Hooks (`zshaddhistory`, `zshremovehistory`)
- When: Adding or removing history entries.
- Use: Filter or manage history.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  zshaddhistory() {
    [[ $1 == *"secret"* ]] && return 1
    return 0
  }
  ```

### 8. `periodic`
- When: At intervals set by `period`.
- Use: Routine checks or updates.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  periodic() {
    echo "Running periodic task..."
  }
  ```

### 9. `add-zsh-hook`
- Purpose: Safely add functions to hooks.
- Use: Append multiple functions without overwriting.
- Example:
  ```zsh
  add-zsh-hook precmd another_precmd
  
  another_precmd() {
    echo "Another precmd function."
  }
  ```

### Summary

Zsh's hook system is versatile, enabling automation and customization:

- `preexec`: Before command execution.
- `precmd`: Before prompt display.
- `chpwd`: On directory change.
- `TRAPDEBUG`: Post-command for debugging.
- `TRAPEXIT`: On shell exit.
- `zle` Hooks: During line editing.
- History Hooks: Managing command history.
- `periodic`: At set intervals.
- `add-zsh-hook`: Adding multiple hook functions.

Utilizing these hooks can greatly enhance your Zsh experience, making your shell more efficient and tailored to your workflow.
