I remember the last time I forgot where I placed the cable for my external hard drive. It’s a common issue—when you back up your data and store the hard drive away, the cable often gets misplaced too. After a year, finding the right cable can be a real hassle.

External hard drives should address this problem by incorporating built-in cables, similar to how some portable power banks come with integrated cables. This design would not only keep everything together but also reduce the risk of losing essential components. With a built-in cable, managing your storage solutions becomes much more convenient and efficient.
