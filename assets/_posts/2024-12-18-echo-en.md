title: "Echo Plays Loud Sounds When Connected"
audio: true
---

When it's the dead of night, family members are sleeping. However, the Echo plays loud sounds when connected. Actually, all products that make sounds in the home should consider how to avoid this problem.

Additionally, the volume of the connection is different from the sound that the user plays. It seems we have no way to control the connected sound.
