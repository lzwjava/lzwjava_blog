Outline Manager provides several server options, including Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail, and others.

For Google Cloud and DigitalOcean, convenient scripts simplify the server setup process. I started with these options because they seemed straightforward. However, these servers sometimes end up getting blocked by the Great Firewall (GFW).

As a result, I decided to try AWS Lightsail again. Although it takes around ten minutes to set up—compared to roughly three minutes with Google Cloud or DigitalOcean—it appears to operate more reliably.

Some decisions may feel troublesome at first, but they often become easier as time goes on. By applying this long-term perspective when choosing your proxy server provider—and in every aspect of your life—you can ultimately enjoy a much better experience.
