## Installation

Begin by downloading and installing V2Ray using the provided installation script.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-26-0-236:~$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2fly/fhs-install-v2ray/master/install-release.sh > in.sh
```

Run the Installation Script:

```bash
chmod +x in.sh
sudo ./in.sh
```

Installation Output:

```
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

## Configuration

### V2Ray Configuration (`config.json`)

This JSON file defines the inbound and outbound settings for V2Ray.

```json
{
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "port": 1080,
            "listen": "0.0.0.0",
            "protocol": "vmess",
            "settings": {
                "clients": [
                    {
                        "id": "9f02f6b2-1d7d-4b10-aada-69e050f1be6b",
                        "level": 0,
                        "alterId": 0,
                        "email": "example@v2ray.com",
                        "security": "auto"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "streamSettings": {
                "network": "tcp"
            },
            "sniffing": {
                "enabled": true,
                "destOverride": [
                    "http",
                    "tls"
                ]
            },
            "tag": "vmess-inbound",
            "udp": true
        }
    ],
    "outbounds": [
        {
            "protocol": "freedom",
            "settings": {},
            "tag": "outbound-freedom",
            "udp": true
        }
    ],
    "log": {
        "loglevel": "debug",
        "access": "/var/log/v2ray/access.log",
        "error": "/var/log/v2ray/error.log"
    },
    "stats": {
        "enabled": false
    },
    "environment": {
        "v2ray.vmess.aead.forced": "false"
    }
}
```

Key Points:
- Inbounds: Defines the entry points for incoming connections. Here, it's set to use the `vmess` protocol on port `1080`.
- Outbounds: Specifies where the traffic should be sent. The `freedom` protocol allows traffic to pass without restrictions.
- Logging: Configured to log access and error information for debugging purposes.
- Security: The `security` field is set to `aes-256-gcm` for enhanced encryption.

### Proxy Configuration (`config.yaml`)

This YAML file configures the proxy settings, DNS, and rules for traffic routing.

```yaml
port: 7890
socks-port: 7891
mixed-port: 7892
allow-lan: true
mode: Rule
log-level: info
external-controller: 0.0.0.0:9090
experimental:
  ignore-resolve-fail: true

dns:
  enable: false
  listen: 0.0.0.0:53
  enhanced-mode: fake-ip
  fake-ip-range: 198.18.0.1/16
  default-nameserver:
    - 119.29.29.29
    - 223.5.5.5
  nameserver:
    - https://223.5.5.5/dns-query
    - https://1.12.12.12/dns-query
  fake-ip-filter:
    - "*.lan"
    - "*.localdomain"
    - "*.example"
    - "*.invalid"
    - "*.localhost"
    - "*.test"
    - "*.local"

proxies:
  - name: "My VMess Proxy"
    type: vmess
    server: 54.254.0.0
    port: 1080
    uuid: "9f02f6b2-1d7d-4b10-aada-0000"
    alterId: 0
    cipher: "aes-128-gcm"
    udp: true

proxy-groups:
  - name: "Proxy"
    type: select
    proxies:
      - "My VMess Proxy"

rules:
  - IP-CIDR,192.168.0.0/16,DIRECT
  - IP-CIDR,10.0.0.0/8,DIRECT
  - IP-CIDR,127.0.0.0/8,DIRECT
  - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
  - MATCH,Proxy
```

Key Points:
- Ports: Configures various ports for HTTP, SOCKS, and mixed traffic.
- DNS: Sets up DNS settings with fake IP ranges and specified nameservers.
- Proxies: Defines a VMess proxy with encryption using `aes-128-gcm`.
- Proxy Groups: Allows selection between different proxy options.
- Rules: Directs traffic based on IP ranges and geographical locations.

Note: Ensure that the `cipher` in the proxy configuration matches the `security` setting in the `config.json`.

## Managing V2Ray Service

After installation and configuration, you need to manage the V2Ray service using `systemctl`.

### Enabling and Starting V2Ray

Enable V2Ray to Start on Boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable v2ray
```

Start V2Ray Service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start v2ray
```

Expected Output:

```bash
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/v2ray.service → /etc/systemd/system/v2ray.service.
```

Verify Service Status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status v2ray
```

Sample Output:

```
● v2ray.service - V2Ray Service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/v2ray.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2024-04-27 12:55:00 UTC; 1min 30s ago
 Main PID: 14425 (v2ray)
    Tasks: 8 (limit: 4915)
   Memory: 36.7M
   CGroup: /system.slice/v2ray.service
           └─14425 /usr/local/bin/v2ray run -config /usr/local/etc/v2ray/config.json
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failure When Enabling V2Ray

Error Message:

```
==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-unit-files ====
Authentication is required to manage system service or unit files.
Authenticating as: Ubuntu (ubuntu)
Password:
polkit-agent-helper-1: pam_authenticate failed: Authentication failure
==== AUTHENTICATION FAILED ====
Failed to enable unit: Access denied
```

Solution:

Ensure you're using `sudo` to execute commands that require administrative privileges.

Correct Command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable v2ray
```

---

## Verification

After starting the V2Ray service, verify that it's running correctly.

### Check Running Processes

```bash
ps aux | grep v2ray
```

Sample Output:

```
nobody     14425  4.4  8.6 5460552 36736 ?       Ssl  12:55   0:00 /usr/local/bin/v2ray run -config /usr/local/etc/v2ray/config.json
ubuntu     14433  0.0  0.5   7076  2176 pts/1    S+   12:55   0:00 grep --color=auto v2ray
```

### Test Connectivity Using Telnet

```bash
telnet your_server_ip 1080
```

Expected Behavior:

- If the connection is successful, you'll see a response from the V2Ray service.
- To exit Telnet, press `Ctrl + ]` and then type `quit`.
