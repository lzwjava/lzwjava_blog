The pin functionality for conversations differs between Telegram and WeChat. In Telegram, the order of pinned conversations remains fixed and does not change. It is likely ordered based on the timestamp when you pinned them, rather than the timestamp of the latest message in those pinned conversations. In contrast, WeChat orders pinned conversations by the timestamp of the most recent message, ensuring that the most active pinned conversations appear first.
