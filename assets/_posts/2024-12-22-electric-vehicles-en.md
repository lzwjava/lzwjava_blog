## Neta

- After upgrading, the system still prompts you to update again.
- The music and navigation volumes can get out of sync. When you try to increase the music volume using the steering wheel controls, the navigation volume unexpectedly increases instead. This can be frustrating, especially if you prefer to keep the navigation sound muted.
- If the battery runs out and you're unable to charge it, you'll need to restart the car by opening the front cover, manually disconnecting the battery, and then reconnecting it to reset the system.

## Tesla

- The Chinese version of Tesla only allows Apple Music and Apple Podcasts to play international content and lacks built-in VPN support.
- Strong internationalization (i18n) support, offering a wide range of language options.
- The naming convention could be clearer. For example, there is no "Model 4"â€”instead, Tesla uses names like "Enhanced Model 3" or "Model Y 2024," which can be confusing.
- In the Model 3, you can't use voice commands to adjust the volume.
- After changing the system language, a restart is required for the changes to take effect.
- Language control is supported across several areas, including the system interface, content, and sound controls.

## Zeeker

- Ranked second in the high-end electric vehicle market, just behind Tesla.
- Poor support for foreign software, limiting its functionality for international users.
- Voice commands for volume adjustment are available, but they are only in Chinese.

## Xiaopeng

- Limited support for foreign software, making it difficult to use certain international applications.
- Voice command "Little P" is used to adjust the volume, but this feature is primarily intended for Chinese users.
