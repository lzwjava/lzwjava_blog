- Use an iPhone as your primary phone, ideally the latest model, or at least one from the last 3 years.

- The second phone can be a Google Pixel, preferably a recent model, but any functional device from the last few years will work.

- The third phone can be an older iPhone or Android device. Use it as a media hub for downloaded podcasts, music, or YouTube videos to listen to in the background.

- Use a crossbody bag for your carry-on. In addition to the three phones, you can also carry earphones and your car key fob.

- The iPhone should be your main device. Install a variety of apps, especially international ones, across all categories, focusing on those with great design and useful features.

- The Pixel can serve as a language-learning tool. Set it to a language you're learning, such as Japanese, for a fresh experience similar to how children learn a language. Download apps from different countries to simulate global travel, and occasionally test Android-specific apps or those that are initially released on Android.

- Explore apps that are exclusive to specific platforms. For example, Gemini was first released on Android, and some independent developers create apps for only one OS.

- Regularly update apps across all devices. Use them naturally and frequently, so you'll instinctively know which phone to reach for depending on the task or situation.
